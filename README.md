# Cellular Automata
1D cellular automata that follows [Rule 18](http://atlas.wolfram.com/01/01/18/) on Wolfram Atlas given random initial conditions.

Just clone the repo and open index.html on your favorite browser :)

### Stuff to do
- Include all the other rules of 1D Cellular Automata (build a 'rule book' of all 256 rules)
- Allow selection of different colors for 'active' and 'inactive' cells
- Maybe have 2D automata?
